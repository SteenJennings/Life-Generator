An output on the GUI should populate, and a CSV of the output will be saved in the local directory.


####### UPDATED FOR GROUP ASSSIGNMENT ########

The program can now run alongside the person-generator.py saved within the same directory.
The program can check to see if there is a file saved in the directory (request.csv) which is generated by the user of the person-genarator program.
If the person-generator program has issued a request, the program will output the results of the toy query from the request.csv
and then display an updated GUI. The program will also save a response.csv file for the person-generator to consume.

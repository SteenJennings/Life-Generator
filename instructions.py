    To run the program with CSV input, make sure you have a properly formatted input file and run the program with the file name as an argument.
    To run the program with Address output, make sure that the Person Generator program has requested Toy information.
    This should be saved in the same directory as "request.csv", then select "Use Address Input" after confirming.
    A csv file will automatically be saved, called "response.csv"."""
